Albany is the capital of New York. It is located on the western bank of the Hudson River. The city is one of the oldest surviving settlements from the original thirteen colonies.

New York City, although much larger and more populous, is not the capital. The state government operates out of Albany, including the governorâ€™s office and legislature.
